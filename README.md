## data 
i watched the first three seasons of the reality TV show Dance Moms to analyze the solos that dancer Maddie Ziegler performed, since she is one of the best dancers on the competition team on the show, and sometimes, her dancing became controversial. the four variables i used were solo, style, placement, and backlash. To gather my data, I watched the show on Hulu. Each unit of analysis was one episode.  

## operationalization
The concept of a solo was operationalized by uisng a qualitative binary coding scheme of 0 or 1. 0 represented an episode where Maddie was not dancing a solo. 1 meant she was. 

The concept of style was operationalized by using a qualitative coding scheme of 1-5. 1 meant her solo was lyrical, 2 meant tap, 3 meant contemporary, 4 meant musical theater, and 5 meant jazz. 

The concept of placement was operationalized by using a quantitative coding scheme of 0-10. 0 meant that Maddie's solo did not place at the episode's competition. 1 meant she won first place, 2 meant she came in 2nd place, 3 meant she came in 3rd place, 4 meant she came in 4th place, 5 meant she came in 5th place, 6 meant she came in 6th place, 7 meant she came in 7th place, 8 meant she came in 8th place, 9 meant she came in 9th place, and 10 meant she came in 10th place. 

The concept of backlash was operationalized by using a quantitative coding scheme of 0-5. I gauged the amount of backlash Maddie received for dancing in the episode by watching the episode and the other moms and girls' opinions on Maddie's solos. 0 meant no backlash, and 5 meant extreme backlash, such as a screaming match or phyiscal altercation.
